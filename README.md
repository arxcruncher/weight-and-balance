# Weight & Balance

This "Simple" javascript-based too calculates and shows the weight and balance (W&B) calculator. It should work out of the box. Though you should enter the weights, arms, and safety enveloppe of your aircraft in the "aircraft.json" file. As an example there is dummy data representing a Piper Warrior III. A unit conversion table is also avaible on the W&B page.
